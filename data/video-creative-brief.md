## Prototype Integration

The hero video (`dreamtraffic-hero-6s.mp4`) plays inline in the Creative Studio section of the Bolt.new prototype. It demonstrates the meta-narrative: a video created with Luma's own Dream Machine, flowing through the full programmatic creative pipeline.

The VAST 4.2 tag wraps this video with IAS, MOAT, and DoubleVerify AdVerification — proving the pipeline from Luma generation through measurement-wrapped delivery.

## Reference Image

The video was generated using image-to-video from `/Users/barracuda/Downloads/BNye.png` as the starting frame.
