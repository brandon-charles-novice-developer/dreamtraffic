Luma AI
Enterprise Account Executive, Advertising

Dear Hiring Team,

I've been following Dream Machine since its early releases. Watching Luma move into advertising is the convergence I've been waiting for — generative AI entering the ecosystem I've spent eight years building a career in, first as a buyer and then as a seller. This isn't another platform differentiating on data or targeting. This is a fundamentally new creative capability, and bringing it to agencies and brands before the playbook exists is exactly the kind of work I want to be doing. Rather than just write about that, I built a working prototype to demonstrate it — DreamTraffic models the full programmatic supply chain for Dream Machine creative: https://prototype-jade-one.vercel.app

At Kargo, I managed a $17.5M enterprise portfolio selling high-impact creative formats that were straightforward to traffic in most DSPs — but Amazon was a different animal, complex enough that it required me to become a platform seller, building AI-driven workflows that accelerated creative builds and freed up time for clients to actually set up their campaigns. When creative approvals became the bottleneck, I got curious enough to teach myself the technical side, wrote the PRD, did the research, and handed product and engineering a spec tight enough that they had a working prototype in fifteen minutes — which was then pitched directly to Amazon's Chief Creative Officer and is rolling out in Q2. That same instinct — see the gap, build for it — is how I architected a third-party tagged programmatic activation from scratch that generated $6.5M in net-new revenue in Year 1, and it's exactly why I built DreamTraffic. The prototype uses Dream Machine to generate the demo creative, then flows it through VAST 4.2 measurement wrapping with IAS/MOAT/DV, multi-DSP trafficking across Amazon DSP, TTD, and DV360, and supply chain fee analysis showing where ADSP's reduced fee structure creates margin headroom for premium AI-generated creative at scale.

I carry established relationships across Omnicom, GroupM, and Publicis, built from eight years on both sides of the table — five years buying media at Hearts & Science, MediaCom, and Zenith before three years selling on the platform side. That range means I understand how agencies actually evaluate new creative technology, what gets a pilot funded, and what turns a test into a multi-year commitment. My fluency across DSPs, SSPs, and measurement lets me meet buyers in their language rather than asking them to learn mine. I'd welcome the chance to talk about how I'd approach Luma's first enterprise advertising accounts.

Sincerely,
Brandon Nye
